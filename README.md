Note: 
-----

- Master is the whole dev environment. Update normally with `$ git push`
- gh-pages is only contanins the /dist directory. Deploy to pages with `$ git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages`
- If this fails completely, just delete the gh-pages branch and then run the subtree command again

You can just stay on master the whole time.
